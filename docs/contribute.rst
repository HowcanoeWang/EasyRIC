Documentation

Build documentation
-------------------

The main documentation documentation is written in
`reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ and
generated by `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_. Hosted publishing by `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ platform.

Documentation has been built on Windows 11 (developing) and Linux (ReadTheDocs platform). Building documentation on macOS may also be possible due to the python cross-platform features but it is not officially tested.
