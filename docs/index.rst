Welcome to EasyIDP's documentation!
===================================

``EasyIDP`` (Easy Intermediate Data Processor) is a handy tool for dealing with region of interest (ROI) on the image reconstruction (Metashape & Pix4D) outputs, mainly in agriculture applications. It provides the following functions:

- Clip ROI on GeoTiff Maps (DOM & DSM) and Point Cloud.
- Backward Projection ROI to original images.
